How to Set Up and Run the Java Project:

Install the project dependencies.

Run the generateKeys.bat file to generate the private-key.pem file. (Note: The certificate is not necessary because the app generates it dynamically.)

If you want Acrobat Reader to trust the user, rename cert.pem to cert.crt and import it into Acrobat Reader.

Finally, run the application.
